Add transitions and animations for smooth sliding effects.
Ensure responsiveness for various screen sizes.
## Enhancement:
1.Thumbnail Navigation : Add a row of thumbnails below the main image slider, allowing users to click on a thumbnail to view the corresponding image.

2.Caption and Description: Include a caption or description for each image, displayed dynamically as the images change.

3.Touch/Swipe Support: Implement touch/swipe functionality for mobile devices to enhance user interaction.

4.Fade Transitions: Instead of sliding, use fading transitions for a different visual effect.
